# Background

# What are Array Comprehensions?

# History

# Example problem

    Note that this relatively simple problem requires usage
    of all of the features achieved through array comprehensions

# Set-builder notation

    Note that there's a mathmetical basis to array comprehensions.

# In different languages

# JavaScript, before array comps

    Note that this requires itterative and destructive
    addition to a variable, against the functional
    concepts we've learned in this class.

    Also note that we included a range function that
    is not present in JavaScript

# JavaScript, with array comps

    Note the lack of itteration, and the return of a
    new array without modifying the operative one.

# Initial abstract syntax

    Note that this is relatively simple and not very flexible 

# Current abstract syntax

    Note that the new syntax facilitates more flexibility
