# Array Comprehensions in JavaScript

    Note that it will be a pretty useful feature that will add
    a lot of value and keep code relatively clean

# Background

# What are Array Comprehensions?

# History

# Example problem

    Note that this relatively simple problem requires usage
    of all of the features achieved through array comprehensions

# Set-builder notation

    Note that there's a mathmetical basis to array comprehensions.

    This is how you might express odd integers < 10000 in math,
    array comprehensions do a similar expression with a similar syntax.

# In different languages

    Here are some examples of how array comp syntax has evolved
    over time, and how it came to be in Python.

    As you'll see soon, Python's syntax is what really motivated
    ES6.

# JavaScript, before array comps

    Note that it's iterative, destructive, and verbose.

    Three things against the concepts we've been taught in
    this class, motivating a more functional approach.

# JavaScript, with array comps

    Note the lack of itteration, and the return of a
    new array without modifying the operative one.

# Initial abstract syntax

    Note that this is relatively simple and not very flexible 

# Current abstract syntax

    As you can see the current abstract syntax has grown,
    and while the abstract syntax is more complicated it
    provides better utility and more flexibilty.

# Implementation progress

# Mozilla

    Firefox has supported array comps since Firefox 2, actually
    before ES6 started adopting them and consequently had a
    slightly different syntax.

    However they've now implemented array comps as ES6 spec'd out

    a little bit into the next slide as community concerns
    are not as important
